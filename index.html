                    Developing a protocol and Excel template, I facilitated the swift and error-free pricing and validation of Indefinite Demand and Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) proposals. These proposals, spanning SINCGARS Re-compete, Iraq, Commercial IDIQ, and SOC Add-on 2, were meticulously priced alongside Random Orders of Magnitude (ROM), Pricing and Availability (P&A), and Make/Buy analyses. Additionally, I oversaw the allocation of Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) and new charge numbers for programs, ensuring meticulous budgeting with Estimates at Completion (EAC) and Estimates to Completion (ETC). Monitoring contractor performance for Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts, I employed the Earned Value Management System (EVMS) for thorough program analysis. Processing weekly labor reports and implementing InfoPath and Access data entry protocols for the Value Based Six Sigma (VBSS) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) project further augmented operational efficiency and accuracy.<br>
