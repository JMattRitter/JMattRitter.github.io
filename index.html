                    In my multifaceted role, I managed a diverse array of financial tasks.  These encompassed weekly labor reporting and tracking, monthly invoicing, and the meticulous preparation of monthly Earned Value Financial reports for 29 programs, with budgets extending up to $21M.  Quarterly, I engaged in high-level discussions with the CFO and General Manager.  These meetings covered critical aspects of financial planning, program updates, and overall program health.  Additionally, I priced proposals for Blue Origin and NASA, which were valued up to $44M.  I worked with Program Management Directors to assess financial program adjustments, ensuring they aligned with strategic goals.

                    April 2017 – April 2020<br>Indianapolis, IN<br><br>
                    In my capacity at Rolls-Royce’s Defense Sector, valued at £3,124M, I played a key role in preparing Incurred Cost Submissions (ICS) and Forward Pricing Rate Proposals (FPRP). I collaborated closely with the Defense Contracting Management Agency (DCMA) and the Defense Contracting Auditing Agency (DCAA) to address Requests for Information (RFI), conduct floor checks, and ensure fairness and reasonableness in our processes. My responsibilities included researching the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), and DCAA’s Contract Audit Manual (CAM) to ensure compliance in preparing ICS and FPRP. I met with DCAA and DCMA to discuss RFIs, FPRP, ICS, and new processes, and attended process walkthroughs and Government Financial Strategy Sessions (GFSS) to discuss accounting changes for the upcoming year. Additionally, I prepared FPRP for 2018 and 2019, and ICS for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, processed monthly estimated rates based on actuals, and improved these processes with Excel macros and formulas. I also reviewed and updated 2016 disclosure statements for Rolls-Royce’s business sectors, loaded rates into SAP, Artemis, and Pricing Templates, and supported government audits and contributed to rate restructuring projects. My active participation and collaborative efforts ensured efficient and compliant financial operations, while also improving various processes within the organization.
